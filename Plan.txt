Populate Database
set up request to Database to serve all investors done
i need to get all commitments - round to what billion it is

set up request to get investor commitments
set up requests for separating investor commitments into asset classes


 =================
UI touchups
change colour schemes

use react router instead of link - replace link tag with p tag 
include style attr in p tag to have hover effect (cursor pointer hover) 
p tag unclick should use react router to navigate to detail page



What I would do different
Use make commands for settings up the project
Use model classes for all of the business logic in fetching investors
and their commitments
