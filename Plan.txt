 =================
UI touchups
change colour schemes

use react router instead of link - replace link tag with p tag 
include style attr in p tag to have hover effect (cursor pointer hover) 
p tag unclick should use react router to navigate to detail page

====================================
## What I would do different

Set up postgres db on rds, use appsync and graphql to manage queries - explain why
potnetially makes point below void, potatoe pitatoe

Use model classes for all of the business logic in fetching investors
and their commitments - explain why this is needed

Use an ORM like sqlachemy for database interactions - explain why this would be beneficial
also explain whats wrong with mvp as it stands

Use typescript?
