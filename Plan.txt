 =================
UI touchups
change colour schemes

use react router instead of link - replace link tag with p tag 
include style attr in p tag to have hover effect (cursor pointer hover) 
p tag unclick should use react router to navigate to detail page

====================================
## What I would do different

Set up rds instance of a db probably postgres, use appsync and graphql to manage queries - this way
all queries are handled through simple graphql queries, no need for tricky python code
all sql can be written in the form of vtl files which consist of sql statements



Also reduce the chance of sql injections, because currently someone could write 
malicious code to drop all data from tables 

Reason for postgres db
ability to easily handle complex queries, transactions, 
and extensive data warehousing operations makes it perfect 
for applications requiring detailed analytics, real-time processing, 
and high data integrity

Another option
Use model classes for all of the business logic in fetching investors
and their commitments - explain why this is needed
Use an ORM like sqlachemy for database interactions
